# Tensorflow numbers recognition

Project implements convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. The classification task is to recognize particular digits on images.

The images with digits are generated randomly, where each digit is randomly shifted, padded and twisted in order to get some variation.
You can easily generate big volume of random images with random digits.


## Neural Net architecture

## How to run

First run script generate_digits.py, set some parameters eg. how many images, how many digits and image size.

Then run the classification script with particular implementation of neural net.
